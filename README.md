Smart Shopper project would help customers shop groceries without preparing purchase list and also help retail store to manage inventories. There are several applications already available in the market with similar features, but the key difference is that those applications provide more information to the retailers and less to the customers. The main objective is to manage customer needs effectively and also provide scope for business intelligence to retailers.
Application identifies the purchase pattern of the user based on which they suggest products to the customer. Application also shows products required for near future (e.g. 10 days) helping users to purchase them in advance, if there is an offer on that product.
Our project includes the below points:
•	Created a project charter and scope statement with clear project objectives, assumptions, deliverables, project success criteria and information about project sponsor and stakeholders.
•	Defined a clear Work Breakdown Structure which starts with Project Initiation and ends with Project closing. 
•	Created a WBS dictionary  which includes the person who is responsible for a particular task, complexity of the task and detailed description of the task.
•	Designed Use case, architecture diagram, Class diagram, sequence diagram which gives detailed description about the project.
